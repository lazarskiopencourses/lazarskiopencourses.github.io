**Question 1:** Create a variable `my_seq1` which will consist of the sequence of integer numbers from -10 to 10 (-10, -9, ..., -1, 0, 1, ..., 9, 10).
Then create a variable `my_seq2` which will consist of the sequence of integer numbers from 0 to 20.
Create a variable `my_seq3`, which will be a sum of squared values of `my_seq1` and 1/3 of values of `my_seq2`, so: (-10^2 + 0/3, -9^2 + 1/3, ..., 9^2 + 19/3, 10^2 + 20/3)
