**Question 2:** Create a dataframe named `data` with the following records:
* `car` = nissan, audi, bmw
* `owner` = Jane, John, Hodor
* `age_person` = 20, 30, 25
* `age_car` = 10, 2, NA
* `sex` = f, m, m (as factor)
* `accident` (whether the car was involved in an accident) = no, yes, no (as boolean)

`car`, `owner`, `age_person`, `age_car`, `sex`, `accident` should be the names of columns.

Create a variable `mean_age_person` with a mean of age of all 3 people.

Create a variable `mean_age_car` with a mean of age of all 3 cars. Omit NA records
To see an argument you have to specify you can type `?mean` in the console
