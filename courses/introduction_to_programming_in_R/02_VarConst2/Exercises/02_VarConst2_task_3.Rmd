**Question 3:** 1. Create two data frames `my.df1` and `my.df2` as:
`my.df1`:
`1	24`
`2	32`
`3	36`
`4	18`

`my.df2`:
`1	max`
`2	woody`
`3	emily`
`4	elen`
`5	john`

with column names: `id` (numeric), `age` (numeric) for `my.df1` and `id` (numeric), `name` (character) for `my.df2`.

Merge `my.df1` and `my.df2` by their `id` column and assign the result to `merged.df` variable. Disregard rows without full information. Type `?merge` in the console for help.

Order whole `merged.df` dataframe by decreasing age. Assign this dataframe to `by_age.df`. Checking `?order` may be useful.
