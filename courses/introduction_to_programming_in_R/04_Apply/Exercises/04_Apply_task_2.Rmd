**Question 2:** Create a function `CheckSize()` that takes as input any list and returns:
* string `List is empty` if the input is an empty list
if not, a list (of the same length as an input list), each element of which is either:
* string `Object is too small` if a length of a given element is smaller than 2
* string `Object is too large` if a length of a given element is greater than 5
* element itself otherwise

Let's see some examples:
`list()` should return `List is empty`
`list(4, 1:5, matrix(1:4, 2, 2), 'I like R', matrix(1:16, 4, 4), c('L', 'A', 'Z', 'A', 'R', 'S', 'K', 'I'))` should return
`[[1]]`
`[1] "Object is too small"`

`[[2]]`
`[1] 1 2 3 4 5`

`[[3]]`
`     [,1] [,2]`
`[1,]    1    3`
`[2,]    2    4`

`[[4]]`
`[1] "Object is too small"`

`[[5]]`
`[1] "Object is too large"`

`[[6]]`
`[1] "Object is too large"`
