**Question 2:** Create a function `CheckSize()` that takes as input any
list and returns the string `List is empty` if the input is an empty
list. If not, a list (of the same length as an input list), each element
of which is either:

-   string `Object is too small` if the length of a given element is
    smaller than 2,
-   string `Object is too large` if the length of a given element is
    greater than 5,
-   element itself otherwise.

Let's see some examples:

1.  

```
> CheckSize(list())
`List is empty`
```

2.  

```
> input = list(4, 1:5, matrix(1:4, 2, 2), 'I like R', matrix(1:16, 4, 4), c('L', 'A', 'Z', 'A', 'R', 'S', 'K', 'I'))
> CheckSize(input)

[[1]][1] "Object is too small"

[[2]] `[1] 1 2 3 4 5`

[[3]] [,1] [,2] [1,] 1 3 [2,] 2 4\`

[[4]] [1] "Object is too small"

[[5]] [1] "Object is too large"

[[6]] [1] "Object is too large"
```
