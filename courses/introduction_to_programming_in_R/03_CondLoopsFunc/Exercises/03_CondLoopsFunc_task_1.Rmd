**Question 1:** # Create `NeitherNA()`, a function that takes two vectors of the same length and returns the number of positions that does NOT have an `NA` in ANY vectors.

e.g. funtion, which takes following input vectors
`c(NA, 1, 2, NA, NA, 1)`
`c(0, NA, 1, NA, 3, 1)`
should return 2

`c(2, 1, 2, 4, NA, 1)`
`c(0, 4, 1, NA, 3, 1)`
should return 4
