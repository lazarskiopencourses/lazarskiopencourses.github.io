**Question 2:** You have been given the `mtcars` dataset, which contains data on different car models and their characteristics. Your task is to use the `dplyr` package to group the data by the number of cylinders (`cyl`) and calculate the minimum and maximum horsepower (`hp`) for each group. Assign these results to the `min_hp` and `max_hp` variables, respectively. The whole output should be stored in the `output` variable, which should look like this:
cyl min_hp max_hp
 4     x      x
 6     x      x
 8     x      x

Hints:
* `group_by()` and `summarize()` may be useful.
* You can use the pipe `%>%` operator.
