```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

**Question 1:** You have been given the built-in `mtcars` dataset, which contains data on different car models and their characteristics. Your task is to use the `dplyr` package to perform the following consecutive operations on the `mtcars` dataset:
* Select only the `mpg`, `cyl`, and `disp` columns (in this order).
* Filter the rows to keep only those where the number of cylinders (`cyl`) is greater than `6`.
* Sort the rows by the values in `mpg` in descending order,
and assign the result to the `output` variable.

Hints:
* You can use the pipe `%>%` operator.
* Package dplyr is loaded in the previous chunk, so there is no need to repeat this action.
