    "**Below is a somewhat formal definition of the Central Limit Theorem. It's not easy to grasp, especially if this is the first time you're learning about the Central Limit Theorem. Don't worry though, things will get clearer in the next subsections, as you will see some examples.**\n",

    "The Central Limit Theorem is a fundamental concept in statistics that states that, given a large enough sample size, the distribution of sample means will be approximately normal, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. In other words, as the sample size increases, the distribution of sample means will become more and more like a normal distribution, even if the population distribution is not normal."

    "Here is an example: imagine you want to know the average height of all adult males in a certain country. But instead of measuring the height of every adult male, which would be impractical, you decide to take a sample of 100 adult males at random. You measure their heights and calculate the average height of this sample, let's say it's 175 cm. Now you repeat this process multiple times, each time taking a sample of 100 adult males and calculating the average height of each sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Central Limit Theorem, even though the population of adult males in the country may have a different distribution of heights, the distribution of the average heights of all these samples will be approximately normal and will have a mean equal to the population mean. This means that you can use the normal distribution to make inferences about the population mean, such as computing a confidence interval for the population mean, or testing a hypothesis about the population mean (more on that in later sections).\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the central limit theorem tells us that if we take many random samples from a population, the mean of those samples will be similar to the mean of the population, and the way those averages are distributed will be in a bell-shaped curve, which is characteristic of the normal distribution. It is also worth knowing that The Central Limit Theorem has several assumptions, such as random sampling, independence of observations, and a large sample size. The exact definition of \"large sample size\" can vary depending on the context and the population distribution, but it is generally considered to be 30 or more."

Therefore, we have to test whether the difference between the means of the two groups is statistically significant (this is where statistical tests come into play).

The **p-value** is the probability of observing our data, if the null hypothesis is true (more will be said about p-values later).

    "As we can see, the p-value is much smaller than 0.01 (note that the p-value might be displayed in scientific notation), therefore we can reject the null hypothesis that the population means are the same. It is also worth mentioning that in this case we performed a double-tailed test, but arguably we could have performed a one-tailed test, because we know that diabetes tends to increase blood glucose levels. If we know the direction of an effect (meaning that an opposite direction does not make sense), we can perform a one-tailed test, which means we divide the p-value in half. However, we have to be very careful when deciding to do a one-tailed test. [Click here](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/faq/pvalue-htm/) to read more about one-tailed tests and when its appropriate to use them."

As our sample size increases, the t distribution approaches the normal distribution (it becomes more and more like the normal distribution). However, if our sample size is small, the t distribution contains \"fatter\" tails.
