## 1. Introduction

Welcome! In this course, you will learn the basics of programming in R. As you could have seen one page before, the course is divided into 6 modules. Each module contains a main R script, as well as several exercises. The amount of work required for each script should be roughly the same. Exercises should be completed and uploaded to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/), if you are officially enrolled in the course.

## 2. Main script

In order to be able to work with this script, you have to download it and open in RStudio. If you don't have RStudio installed, and you don't know how to do it, instruction from [this site](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) should help. To download a script, you have to click somewhere using right click on the mouse, choose `Save as` and make sure that you are saving the file using correct extension, which is `.R`.

## 3. Exercises

To solve exercises, you have to download script and write your solution in the `
```{r} # YOUR CODE HERE```
` chunk. 
This time, extension of a file should be `.Rmd`.
